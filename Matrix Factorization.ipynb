    "<b>What is a Matrix Decomposition? </b>\n",
    "\n",
    "A matrix decomposition is a way of reducing a matrix into its constituent parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is an approach that can simplify more complex matrix operations that can be performed on the decomposed matrix rather than on the original matrix itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common analogy for matrix decomposition is the factoring of numbers, such as the factoring of 25 into 5 x 5. For this reason, matrix decomposition is also called matrix factorization. Like factoring real values, there are many ways to decompose a matrix, hence there are a range of different matrix decomposition techniques.\n"

    "The LU decomposition is for square matrices and decomposes a matrix into L and U components.\n",
    "\n",
    "A = L . U\n",
    "\n",
    "Where A is the square matrix that we wish to decompose, L is the lower triangle matrix and U is the upper triangle matrix. A variation of this decomposition that is numerically more stable to solve in practice is called the LUP decomposition, or the LU decomposition with partial pivoting.\n",
    "\n",
    "A = L . U . P\n",
    "\n",
    "The rows of the parent matrix are re-ordered to simplify the decomposition process and the additional P matrix specifies a way to permute the result or return the result to the original order. There are also other variations of the LU.\n",
    "\n",
    "The LU decomposition is often used to simplify the solving of systems of linear equations, such as finding the coefficients in a linear regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "The LU decomposition can be implemented in Python with the lu() function. More specifically, this function calculates an LPU decomposition."
